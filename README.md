# Dust-Particle-Prediction-using-LSTM-Python
The aim of the project was to develop a machine learning model to predict the dust particle concentration in a particular environment given other parameters such as pressure etc.
Here we make use of LSTMs for prediction. The data set which is used was for the city of kolkata, India.
